VERSION 1.1 CHANGELOG**************************************************************************

TODO LIST:
- Implement a way for the system to remember to only display the intro slideshow on the first launch
- Change the showAlert boolean into an NSUserDefaults thing so the Rate My App alert works properly
- Add  easy, medium, hard game modes with buttons that fade in and out if lets go is pressed that alter sensitivity
- This time make sure the app goes in the games section LOL
- Have a second game mode for countdown - using a countdown timer.
- Push notifications to get people to keep playing.
- Add photo backgrounds instead of gradients. No longer is the flat look necessary.
- Change icon to be more vibrant and neon-y. No clue what that means for now but I'll figure it out LOL.
- Document all of the code (something I should have been doing since day 1)
- Switch to iRate instead of my custom implementation for creating the rating dialoge.

CHANGELOG:
+ Changed the default text that shows up when sharing on facebook or twitter.
+ Deleted the scoring mechanism -- it's redundant and not needed since the time lasted can be used as a scoring mechanism anyways.
+ Changed the high score label to adapt to the amount of time that the user lasted.
