TODO LIST:
- Implement a way for the system to remember to only display the intro slideshow on the first launch


CHANGELOG:
+ Changed the default text that shows up when sharing on facebook or twitter.
+ Deleted the scoring mechanism -- it's redundant and not needed since the time lasted can be used as a scoring mechanism anyways.
+ Changed the high score label to adapt to the amount of time that the user lasted.
